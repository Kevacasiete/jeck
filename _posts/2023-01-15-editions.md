description: Inspired by the Scottish tradition of meeting researchers from all over Scotland shortly before going to CHI, in 2019 this tradition was brought by Offis (Oldenburg) to Germany to bring the German HCI community and friends closer together.

Since 2017, the German HCI event accompanies the ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems and serves as a platform to promote our publications & labs as well as get in contact with researchers from all over the world.

- 2017 – German HCI @ CHI in Denver, US
