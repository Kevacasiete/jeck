description: Unfortunately, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this year’s CHI will not be held. In order to honor the tradition of the German HCI event, we curated this website to provide details of this year’s publications from the involved labs.

With 83 accepted papers and 34 LBWs, German researchers provided a sizable contribution to CHI 2020. Due to the cancellation of the conference, we wanted to honor the German contribution by organizing the Virtual German CHI Week. This event took place from May 25th – May 29th 2020.

The Organizers
What to Expect
Through short paper presentations and panel discussions with international experts in the respective field, we aim to increase the visibility of the German HCI research and enable authors to receive valuable feedback on their work they would miss without CHI. 

The event is open to everyone (with no registration required) and we hope to see many of you there. All talks and discussion will be in English!

The sessions will be hosted via a Zoom Webinar and allow for actively participating in the Q&As. In case you cannot or do not want to use Zoom, we will also live stream the sessions on YouTube. The sessions will not be recorded. After the last session on each day, we invite everyone to join us on Mozilla Hub for a after-work hangout.
